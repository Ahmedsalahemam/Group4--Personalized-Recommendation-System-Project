# Group4--Personalized-Recommendation-System-Project

The objective of this project was to develop a personalized recommendation system for movies, leveraging datasets 
from Netflix and Disney. The goal was to provide users with tailored movie suggestions based on content features such as 
genres, cast, and descriptions. Due to the absence of user interaction data, we adopted a content-based approach, utilizing 
key attributes of each movie to predict relevance to users' preferences. Additionally, collaborative filtering methods were 
explored to enhance the recommendation quality by using item similarity.
We employed machine learning models and advanced techniques, including matrix factorization and hybrid 
recommendation algorithms, to optimize the recommendation process. The system was integrated with Azure for scalable 
deployment and continuous model updates using MLOps principles.
Key outcomes included an efficient recommendation engine capable of delivering relevant movie suggestions, as well as a 
robust Azure infrastructure supporting seamless scaling and real-time recommendations. The final evaluation demonstrated 
the system's effectiveness in improving user satisfaction by delivering personalized content
